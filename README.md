This project involves creating a navigation bar and an HTML form. Both elements are styled to provide a clean and functional layout, but responsive design is not yet implemented.

Key Features:
Navigation Bar:

A simple navigation bar that includes links to various sections of the website (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
Links are styled with hover effects for better interactivity.
Currently, the navigation bar is designed for a desktop layout and does not adjust for mobile or smaller screens.
HTML Form:

A basic form for collecting user information (e.g., name, email, etc.).
The form includes input fields and a submit button.
Validation is applied to ensure required fields are filled out before submission.
Styling:
Both the navigation bar and form are styled with CSS to create a clean, professional look.
Button hover effects and other design details are included to enhance the user experience.
While styling is applied, the design is fixed for desktop use and does not adapt to mobile or smaller screen sizes.
Project Structure:
index.html: Contains the structure for both the navigation bar and the form.
styles.css: Contains all the necessary styles to style the navigation bar, form, and page layout.
Limitations:
The layout is not responsive and does not automatically adjust for mobile devices or different screen sizes.
To make the design fully responsive, additional CSS media queries will need to be implemented.
